excerpt: My journey building a network-attached storage for home media and movies.

<p>
    To end off the summer of my freshman year, I wanted to build a sweet home server setup. The server would
    store home photos and videos that were scattered across the house in SSDs, SD cards, CDs, and DVDs. I wanted to
    consolidate all these onto one device, with redundant storage and easy access. I also wanted a place
    to store all the DVD and Blurips I've been working on from my family's collection.
</p>
<h3>Researching</h3>
<p>
    The first step is researching which parts you want to get. This all depends on what you
    want your NAS (Network-Attached Storage) to do. Traditionally, they are exclusively used for
    storing files in a filesystem connected to a network, but I'm stretching the definition a bit to include
    running my virtualized apps, such as Jellyfin.
    <br/><br/>
    My go-to website for picking my PC parts is the aptly named <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">pcpartpicker.com</a>.
    This website's great as not only does it give you direct links to retailer sites where a part is being sold, but the price history
    of that part, and if it's compatible with the rest of your build. Here is my build:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Motherboard: MBD-X11SCH-F-O</p></li>
        <li><p>CPU: Intel Xeon E-2176G</p></li>
        <li><p>RAM: 32 GB of Crucial ECC UDIMM DDR4 RAM at 2666 Mhz</p></li>
        <li><p>Case: Fractal Design Node 804</p></li>
        <li><p>Storage: WD Red Plus 8TB NAS Hard Drive x2</p></li>
        <li><p>Power Supply: Corsair Modular 80 Plus Gold 650 W</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I picked this combination for a few reasons. This particular SuperMicro motherboard supports IPMI, 
        ECC memory, has 8 SATA3 ports for hard drives, and supports the C246 chipset.
        All of these attributes make for an amazing TrueNAS setup with ZFS. The ZFS file
        structure has built in redundancy features such as copy-on-write, built-in snapshot functionality,
        and data integrity checks. ZFS makes heavy use of RAM for these features, which is why
        ECC (error correcting code) RAM is a must for this particular filesystem, although technically not required.
        <br/><br/>
        Additionally, the 8 SATA3 ports allow for plenty of storage expansion. Photos and videos take up a lot of storage
        space, so I opted for two 8 Tb NAS hard drives in a mirrored array (RAID 0). This allows for 1:1 data redundancy
        if one drive fails, and also allows for faster read times since it can pull from both drives. WD's NAS hard drives are supposed to have great reliability, and they
        were relatively cheap for 8 Tb. the C246 chipset allows
        for hardware accelerated transcoding with Intel QSV, which will be great for media streams. The Intel Xeon CPU I chose has capable transcoding abilities
        with 6 cores. My motherboard also has support for IPMI, which allows for remote 
        control of the computer. This allows for remote power cycling, diagnostics, and BIOS access.
        And with the use of a VPN, I can easily manage my home server from anywhere.
        <br/><br/>
        Ultimately, my NAS build came out to be around $1,000. I bought a combination of used
        and new parts that I found on sale. When building a new computer, if you are going used,
        I would recommend the CPU, RAM, and the case (if screws come included). Never buy a used
        motherboard, power supply, or hard drive, as they are usually the first items in your computer
        to fail. Plus if you do buy used, at best the parts can be sketchy, and at worst they can be
        fire hazards (power supply)!
    </p>
    <h3>Building</h3>
    <p> The computer case I chose has a unique form factor. It has two distinct sections: one to
        hold the 8 hard drive bays and the power supply, and the other side holds everything else like
        the motherboard.

    <p>
        I always make sure to put everything on the motherboard first before putting it the case,
        because it's pretty hard to screw and attach stuff in the case. Below is a picture of the CPU installation.
    </p>
    <img class="zoomable-image" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/{{page.title}}/IMG_0292.jpg"/>
    <p>Because the RAM slots are above the motherboard instead of the side, I accidentally installed the
        CPU cooler the wrong way. Always pay attention to which side your IO shield is on in relation to your case!
    </p>
    <img class="zoomable-image" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/{{page.title}}/IMG_0293.jpg"/>
    <p>Once I had everything in the motherboard and in the right orientation, I screwed
        it into the case. After that, all that's left to do is plug in the USB and LED case wires,
        fan wires, SATA3 hard drive cables, and power supply cables. 
    </p>
    <img class="zoomable-image" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/{{page.title}}/IMG_0295.jpg"/>
    <p>Also fun fact, you will need two ethernet cables for wired connectivity, as the
        chip that allows for IPMI actually runs independently of the computer and even has it's own
        IP address!
    </p>
    <h3>Setting Up The OS</h3>
    <p>The operating system I will be using is TrueNAS scale, a Linux based operating system
        with built-in support for virtual containers with Docker. TrueNAS is meant to be installed directly onto
        storage and not through a hypervisor, which is exactly what I'll be doing.
        <br/><br/>
        I first made sure I had my boot storage installed in my computer. I chose to use
        two 120 Gb M.2 for a redundant boot drive since my motherboard came with two M.2 slots.
        Next, I installed a USB live boot from the <a href="https://www.truenas.com/download-truenas-scale/">TrueNAS website</a>
        onto a USB drive.
        After plugging the USB drive into my computer and choosing it to boot, I followed the simple
        on screen instructions. I made sure to choose that I wanted a redundant boot drive (use both M.2 storages).
        <br/><br/>
        Once TrueNAS Scale finished installing, I rebooted into the BIOS to change a couple settings before
        going into my freshly installed boot drive. I changed the power settings so that the computer always turned back on automatically
        if power goes out, and I made sure my boot drive was the first slot in the boot order.
        After rebooting into the boot drive TrueNAS was just installed on, it should tell you the IP address of the web server
        TrueNAS scale runs on, which is where the setup will continue and where TrueNAS will be managed 99% of the time.
        <br/><br/>
        From there, all I really had to do is set up an account and storage pool and then I was free to go!
        You can set up all sorts of things, like allowing your storage to be accessible through the Windows file explorer
        as a network drive, assigning account permissions to certains folders, setting up automated snapshots, docker apps, and so much more.
        Right now, I have a Jellyfin server set up for my movies and a Windows SMB share set up for accessing family
        photos and videos. TrueNAS is a powerful tool for starting and growing your own homelab, and I wholeheartedly
        recommend it!
