<p>
    To end off the summer of my freshman year, I wanted to build a sweet home server setup. The server would
    store home photos and videos that were scattered across the house in SSDs, SD cards, CDs, and DVDs. I wanted to
    consolidate all these onto one device, with redundant storage and easy access. I also wanted a place
    to store all the DVD and Blurips I've been working on from my family's collection.
