    So it's no longer highschool and I need an updated personal website. However,
    my first digital portfolio was more of a experiment rather than an actual portfolio.
    I never updated since it's creation, and it's really cringe (but I'll keep it online
    just for fun üòÅ).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So it's 7:40 PM on Saturday, September 7th right now and I spent about 5 hours experimenting with
    Jekyll. I tried starting out with a template, but none of them looks how I wanted,
    and of course I wanted how to learn how to do everything from scratch, or else I'd lose my 
    mind. The <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">step by step tutorial</a>
    in the Jekyll docs is where I ended up at, and it cleared up a lot of confusion I had when jumping
    head first into a theme template.
