    So it's no longer highschool and I need an updated personal website. However,
    my first digital portfolio was more of a experiment rather than an actual portfolio.
    I never updated it since it's creation, and it's really cringe (but I'll keep it online
    just for fun üòÅ).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So it's 7:40 PM on Saturday, September 7th right now and I spent about 5 hours experimenting with
    Jekyll. I tried starting out with a template, but none of them looks how I wanted,
    and of course I wanted how to learn how to do everything from scratch, or else I'd lose my 
    mind. The <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">step by step tutorial</a>
    in the Jekyll docs is where I ended up at, and it cleared up a lot of confusion I had when jumping
    head first into a theme template.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    Before starting the website, I wanted to familiarize myself with what Jekyll had to offer.
    For example, built-in code highlighting can be accomplished easily with Liquid syntax
    highlighting. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    {% highlight liquid %}{% raw %}
    {% highlight javascript %}
    function helloWorld {
        var myVar = 10;
    }
    {% endhighlight %}{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
    <br/>
    Turns into: 
    </p>
    {% highlight javascript %}
        function helloWorld() {
            var myVar = 10;
        }{% endhighlight %}
    <p>
    <br/>
    Pretty cool huh? Liquid allows for a lot of cool formatting and filtering tricks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Looking at the bigger picture however, Jekyll makes it easy to structure multi-page websites.
    You can utilize the <strong>_layouts</strong> folder to create page templates,
    which allows for easy implementation of a universal navigation bar, header, or footer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One of these layouts I chose to use is for posts, which have an especially easy implementation
    with Jekyll. First you have to create a <strong>_posts</strong> folder. Each post in that
    folder has to follow a specific name format in order for the title and date to be
    automatically determined. For example, this page's file is called <strong>"2024-09-07-Making-My-Digital-Portfolio.html"</strong>.
    The date comes first in the filename, then the title, with hyphens representating spaces. Of course
    this format can be changed in the <strong>_config.yml</strong> file, which contains global 
    variables, default URLs, and other Jekyll customization options.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only thing left to do is to add a page that can provide access these individual
    blog links, preferably using an iteration. Luckily, iterations are easily done through liquid.
    For example, my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog.html">Blog</a> page uses a for loop like this:
    {% highlight liquid %}{% raw %}
        {% for post in site.posts %}
            {% comment %} 
                Add and style individual blog post links 
            {% endcomment %}
        {% endfor %}{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you implement access to each blog page, that's pretty much it. Everything else
        comes down to customization and what pages you want or don't want to implement.
        Thank you for reading my first blog on my brand new website!
